# CitiBike Trip History in NY using Tableau
In this project I used Python to merge multiple .csv files containing Citi Bike Trip History logs. After a quick exploration of the data, I imported the merged file into Tableau and analyzed the use of Citi bikes in New York City from April 2017 through May 2018. I created a workbook, which includes visualizations and a short summary of my findings.
